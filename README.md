# Disclaimer

This Project was built for lerning purposes on how to develop production grade API using `Node.js` 💪 , so by any means its considered 'FINISHED', i'm still working on it 👨🏽‍🏭, so feel free to open issues on submit Pull requests, all contribution are welcome 😉!

🚀 The developement process can be tracked throught the commits, and here is what was implemented so far :

- `Prisma` setups and models creation (User, Product, Update, ...)
- Adding the necessary packages for a swcure/maitainable server: Express, Cors, ...
- Implementing REST endpoints for our Models.
- Handeling authentication and protecting our main routes by implementing an auth middleware using `JWT`.
- Implementing a middleware for Input Validation using `express-validator`
- Implementing a middleware to gracefully handle errors from our `express` route handlers or even from the `node.js` server.
